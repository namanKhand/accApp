# Competitive Analysis

## Market Snapshot
- **Habit Tracker**: strong tracking UI but entirely self-managed; no partner accountability.
- **HabitShare**: shares habits with friends; partners remain passive observers without intervention prompts.
- **Streaks**: polished personal tracker; no social accountability or partner nudging.
- **Habitica**: gamified productivity; social layer is optional and diluted.
- **Productive**: visually strong personal habit tracker; lacks partner or community elements.
- **Stickk / Coach.me / Dial In**: accountability-oriented but varying in social depth and enforcement.

## Differentiators
- Partners are responsible co-pilots: missed check-ins trigger partner action, not just user guilt.
- Photo proof + streaks: tangible evidence with daily reinforcement.
- Nudging workflow: explicit prompts for partners to intervene when goals slip.
- Shared visibility: both user and partner see streaks, misses, and pending nudges.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Low partner engagement** → in-app reminders for partners, streak impact tied to partner responsiveness.
- **Check-in fatigue** → quick photo capture, smart defaults, flexible cadence.
- **Privacy concerns** → clear sharing controls and minimal data collection.
