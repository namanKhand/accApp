# Product Vision

## Mission
Help people stick to personal goals by making accountability a shared responsibility between the user and their chosen partner.

## One-Liner
A social accountability app where users set goals, check in with photo proof, and rely on accountability partners who nudge them to stay consistent.

## Philosophy
- Accountability is shared: partners are co-pilots, not spectators.
- Proof beats promises: daily photo check-ins and streaks keep progress visible.
- Social investment matters: people are more consistent when someone else is invested in their success.

## Target Users
- People who want external accountability to stay consistent.
- Friends or partners who are motivated to support and actively nudge.

## Goals
- Make accountability partners visible, empowered, and responsible.
- Provide clear, lightweight check-ins with photo proof.
- Reinforce consistency via streaks, reminders, and nudges.

## Success Metrics
- Daily active check-ins per user.
- Percentage of goals with at least one accountability partner.
- Nudge responsiveness rate (time from missed check-in to partner nudge).
- Streak retention (1, 2, 4-week streak completion rates).
